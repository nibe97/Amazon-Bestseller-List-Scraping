# Amazon-Bestseller-List-Scraping
Hello, I am an absolute beginner and would like to scrape the Amazon bestseller page. I want a table with the product name, rank, rating, number of ratings, and price. My code works well but only extracts ranks 1-30 and 51-80. I think it's related to the page scrolling. But neither the threads here nor ChatGPT could help me. Any tips?
